# Release

The `Release` workflow automates the release process for the repository. It is
triggered on pushes to the `main` branch and when a new tag is created.

## Trigger Conditions

- **Runs on Pushes to the `main` Branch**: The workflow is activated every time
  new commits are pushed to the `main` branch. This ensures that any changes
  merged into `main` — either directly or through pull requests — automatically
  trigger the release process. This functionality ensures that the `main` branch
  is always in a release-ready state.

- **Triggers on New Git Tags**: The workflow is also activated when a new Git
  tag is created. Tags in Git are often used to mark specific points in your
  repository history as being important, usually to indicate a new version
  release. Whenever a new tag is pushed to the repository or created through
  GitHub's interface, the workflow is triggered. This allows for
  version-specific releases and assets to be automatically generated and
  published.

## Permissions

The workflow has write access to the repository content.
