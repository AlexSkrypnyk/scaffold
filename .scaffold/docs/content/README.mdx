# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for Scaffold, your go-to repository for
kick-starting your projects!

If you're tired of setting up your project environment from scratch each time
you begin a new venture, you're in the right place.

Scaffold is designed to give you a consistent and tested foundation for your
projects, so you can focus on the important stuff.

## Quick start

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/releases/latest)
2. Run `./init.sh` to replace `yournamespace`, `yourproject`, `Your Name` and
   other strings with your own and choose the features.
3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
