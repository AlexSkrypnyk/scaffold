```bash

## Publishing to Netlify on pull requests

Documentation is published to Netlify on every pull request and merge to `main`
using the [Deploy Docs to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)
GitHub Action.

Deployed documentation link will be added to the pull request as a comment.

### Netlify configuration

Set up a new site on Netlify and add the following environment variables
to the `Secrets and variables > Actions > Repository secrets` in GitHub settings:

- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID` - `Site > Site configuration > General > Site details > Site information > Site ID`
- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN` - `User settings > Applications > Personal access tokens > New access token`

## Publishing to GitHub pages on release

Documentation is published to GitHub Pages on release (tag) using
the [Deploy Docs to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yml)
GitHub Action.

This GitHub Action is designed to automatically build and publish documentation
to GitHub Pages.

The action uses concurrency controls to cancel any in-progress runs
if a new run is initiated, ensuring that only the latest changes are deployed.

The environment for this job is set to `github-pages`, and the URL for the
deployed page is dynamically generated.

## Terminalizer

[Terminalizer](https://www.terminalizer.com/) is a software tool that allows
users to record their terminal sessions and generate animated GIFs or shareable
web player recordings.

This template provides a default [Terminalizer configuration file](./../terminalizer.yml)
that can be used to generate GIFs for your documentation.
