# Dotfiles

## `.editorconfig`

The `.editorconfig` file serves as a configuration file for your text editor,
enforcing consistent coding styles across multiple file types in the project.
It ensures that different editors follow the same indentation and formatting
rules, leading to more readable and maintainable code.

This template provides a [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/.editorconfig)
file with some sensible defaults.

Read more about the EditorConfig standard at [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).

## `.gitignore`

The `.gitignore` file specifies files and folders that should be ignored by Git,
ensuring that they are not tracked or committed to the repository. This helps in
keeping the repository clean from files that are not source code,
like dependencies and build artifacts.

This template provides a [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/.gitignore)
file with some sensible defaults to ignore files and folders that are commonly
ignored in PHP and Node.js projects.

To ignore OS temporary files use [global `.gitignore`](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/ignoring-files#configuring-ignored-files-for-all-repositories-on-your-computer).

Read more about the `.gitignore` files in the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).

## `.gitattributes`

The `.gitattributes` file sets attributes on a path-by-path basis for the
repository, affecting how Git handles certain files. In this case, it specifies
files and folders to be excluded when creating distribution archives of
the repository.

This template provides a [`.gitattributes`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/.gitattributes)
file with some sensible defaults to ignore files and folders when creating an
archive for distribution. For example, when creating a release on GitHub.
