# Linting

Code linting is the automated checking of source code for programmatic and
stylistic errors. This is done by running a program called a "linter" against
the code base. Linters are used to identify common coding mistakes, enforce a
coding standard, and offer simple suggestions for code optimization. They can be
integrated into the development process as a step in automated build systems or
as plugins for text editors and IDEs. By catching errors early in the
development process, linting helps to improve the quality of code and can make
the debugging process more efficient.

## Usage

To lint code, run:

```bash
shellcheck shell-command.sh tests/bats/*.bash tests/bats/*.bats
shfmt -i 2 -ci -s -d shell-command.sh tests/bats/*.bash tests/bats/*.bats
```

To fix linting errors, run
```bash
shfmt -i 2 -ci -s -w shell-command.sh tests/bats/*.bash tests/bats/*.bats
```
