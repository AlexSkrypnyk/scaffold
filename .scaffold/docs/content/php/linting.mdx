# Linting

Code linting is the automated checking of source code for programmatic and
stylistic errors. This is done by running a program called a "linter" against
the code base. Linters are used to identify common coding mistakes, enforce a
coding standard, and offer simple suggestions for code optimization. They can be
integrated into the development process as a step in automated build systems or
as plugins for text editors and IDEs. By catching errors early in the
development process, linting helps to improve the quality of code and can make
the debugging process more efficient.

## Usage

To lint code, run `composer lint` command.

To fix linting errors, run `composer lint-fix`.

## PHP Code Sniffer

This template provides integration with [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer),
which analyzes PHP files and detects violations of a defined set of coding
standards.

This template adheres to Drupal coding standards, which are defined
in [`drupal/coder`](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) package. The package
is installed as a development dependency.

The [`phpcs.xml`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/phpcs.xml)
file contains a template ruleset with minimal configuration, serving as an
initial foundation for further customization of coding standards. For example,
long arrays and missing method name descriptions are allowed in test files.

By default, the linter runs with showing sniff codes, progress and colors.

An example of annotated ruleset with all available options can be found on
[the Annotated Ruleset page](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Annotated-Ruleset).

## PHPStan

This template provides integration with [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), the
PHP Static Analysis Tool.

PHPStan focuses on finding errors in your code without actually running it.
It catches whole classes of bugs even before you write tests for the code.
It moves PHP closer to compiled languages in the sense that the correctness of
each line of the code can be checked before you run the actual line.

The [`phpstan.neon`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/phpstan.neon)
file contains a template ruleset with minimal configuration, serving as an
initial foundation for further customization of coding standards.

The rule configuration is set to the level `9` (the strictest).

This template's source code files and tests were developed according to the
standards, and they pass this check. In your project, you can adjust the level
to your needs.

The full configuration reference is available on
the [PHPStan website](https://phpstan.org/config-reference).

## Rector

This template provides integration with [Rector](https://getrector.com/), a tool
that instantly upgrades and refactors the PHP code of your application.

Rector now supports upgrades from PHP 5.3 to 8.2 and major open-source projects
like Symfony, PHPUnit, and Doctrine.

Rector helps with automated refactoring when you have code quality you need,
but struggle to keep it with new developers in your team.

Add Rector to your CI and let it continuously refactor your code and keep the
code quality high.

The [`rector.php`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/rector.php)
file contains a template ruleset with minimal configuration, serving as an
initial foundation for further customization of coding standards.

The full configuration reference is available on
the [Rector website](https://getrector.com/documentation/).
