# Composer

[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries
your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you.

This template uses Composer to manage dependencies and provide scripts for
linting and testing code.

The provided [`composer.json`](https://github.com/AlexSkrypnyk/scaffold/blob/main/composer.json) file contains the following sections:

- **Project Information**:
Metadata like name, description, and license.

- **Author and Support**:
Includes maintainer details and URLs for issues and source code.

- **Dependencies**:
Requires PHP version `>= 8.2`. If using as base for CLI command,
`symfony/console` is provided as a dependency as well.

- **Development Dependencies**:
Tools like [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), and [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) for development are listed.

- **Auto-loading**:
PSR-4 standard is used for auto-loading classes from the `src` directory.

- **Dev Auto-loading**:
Auto-loads classes for development from `tests/phpunit` directory.

- **Custom Scripts**:
Defines CLI scripts for tasks:
  - `lint` and `lint-fix` - to lint and fix code using [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer), [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/), and [Rector](https://getrector.org/).
  - `test` - to run PHPUnit tests without generating coverage report.
  - `test-coverage` - to run PHPUnit tests and generate coverage report.
  - `build` - to build a PHAR file (if using as base for CLI command).

- **Executable Binaries**:
Executable binaries are defined as executable scripts in `bin` directory,
which makes them easily accessible without cluttering the global scope.

- **Configuration**:
Composer is configured with the following settings:

  - **Discard Changes**:
  Automatically discards any changes to the `composer.lock` file that are not committed. This ensures a clean state for the dependency versions defined in `composer.json`.

  - **Sort Packages**:
  Ensures that the packages in `composer.json` are sorted, which helps in maintaining a consistent and organized structure. Run `composer normalize` to sort the packages.

  - **Minimum Stability**:
  Sets the minimum stability to `stable`, meaning that only stable versions of packages will be considered when resolving dependencies. You can change this to `dev` or `alpha` if you want to include unstable versions in your project.

  - **Prefer Stable**:
  Prefers stable versions of packages over unstable ones, providing more reliable and tested packages unless a specific unstable version is required.
