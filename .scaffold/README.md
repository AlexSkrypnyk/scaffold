## Scaffold Testing

This directory contains tests specifically designed to **validate** and ensure
the **integrity** of the `scaffold` template itself. They are _not_ meant for
the end-users or the projects derived from this template.

After you clone the repository and run the `init.sh` script, this directory and
its contents will be automatically removed to ensure a clean project structure.
It's essential to understand that these tests are for internal purposes only and
are not part of the final project structure that you will be working on.
