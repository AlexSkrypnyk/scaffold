# Test

The `Test` workflow configure GitHub Actions for your repository to
automatically run tests on pull requests and pushes to specific branches.
The workflow includes steps for linting, testing, and code coverage.

## Trigger conditions

- **Pull Requests**: The workflow activates whenever a new pull request is
  created or an existing one is updated. It triggers for pull requests targeting
  the `main` branch, any branch that begins with `feature/`, or even between
  feature branches themselves. For example, a pull request
  from `feature/new-button` to `feature/new-layout` would also activate the
  workflow. This ensures automated testing for changes aimed at both the
  stable `main` branch and ongoing work in feature-specific branches.

- **Pushes**: The workflow also activates whenever new commits are pushed
  directly to the `main` branch. This could be a direct commit or a merge from a
  pull request. This action ensures that the `main` branch is continually in a
  deployable and stable state according to the defined tests and checks.

- Checks out code and caches Composer dependencies.
- Installs dependencies via Composer.
- Runs linting and tests with code coverage.
- Publishes coverage report with a 90% threshold to the associated pull
  request.

## Node.js job

- Runs on `ubuntu-latest`.
- Checks out code.
- Sets up Node.js environment.
- Installs npm dependencies.
- Runs linting and tests.

## Code coverage

The workflow publishes code coverage reports for PHP and Node.js projects to
the relevant pull request. This helps you keep track of code coverage and make
sure that new code is sufficiently tested.

[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) is used to track code coverage using
reports generated by test tooling.

The [`codecov/codecov-action`](https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action)
action is used to send coverage reports to Codecov.

To setup Codecov for your repository, follow the steps in the [official Codecov
documentation](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/quick-start#section-add-repository).
Note that Codecov is free for open source projects and does not require a
secret token to be set up.
